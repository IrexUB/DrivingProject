# DrivingProject

3D game made on Unity in the style "Endless runner". 
The objective of this project was to have a first idea of what a 3D game could look like. 

During this project I tried to optimize as much as possible the physical calculations which are not necessary, by trying for example to generate the pieces of roads based on the position of the player rather than with collisions calculations.

## Game modes

### Versus mode 
Two players play on a split screen, their objective is to reach the highest distance on a procedurally generated road full of pitfalls. To encourage replayability I was inspired by Mario Kart by adding object boxes that will give bonus or malus.

### Chrono mode
Playable in solo only. The player has the possibility to choose a timer he wants to beat. The main objective of this mode was to see more in detail the persistence of data in video games, especially with JSON files.
